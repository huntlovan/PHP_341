<!-- Deprecated single-file example replaced by reusable implementation.
See: ImageUploader.php, upload.php, and index.html for the improved reusable image upload solution.
Retained original instructional directions below for reference. -->
<?php
// This file kept only as a pointer. Real logic now lives in ImageUploader.php + upload.php.
// If you still need a minimal procedural example, you could adapt:
// 1. Validate image via getimagesize
// 2. Enforce allowed extensions (jpg, jpeg, png, gif)
// 3. Limit size to 500KB
// 4. Prevent overwriting existing files
// 5. move_uploaded_file to /uploads directory
