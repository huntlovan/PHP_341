Create Update Form for an Event
Create a form that will update a selected event from the selectEvents.php page. 

The form called updateEvent.php should do the following:

The form should use the 'recid' to get the selected event data from the database. 
It should load the data into the form fields.
Display the form to the user and allow for changes. 
Apply the form token method we learned in class to protect your form from CSRF.
Optionally - add a honeypot to protect your form from bots.
UPDATE the record in the database.
Provide a confirmation message upon completion.
