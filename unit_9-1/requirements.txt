For this assignment you are going to practice using the SELECT command to pull the data from a table in your database.  You will also need to sort the data using the SQL SORT command.

Use the attached wdv341_products.sql file as the basis for your project. Insert the table into your wdv341 database. 

Use the layout and CSS provided in the retail-products.php page.

Do the following:

1. Your program should pull all rows from the table.
Sort in Descending order by product name. 
2. For each row in your table format the content as described in the comments on the retail-products.php file.
If there is content in the product_status field display the contents and apply the productStatus class to the p container.
If the product_inventory is less than 10 then apply the productLowInventory class to the inventory p container.
When finished post your assignment to your domain and update the links in your homework page. 

Submit your assignment on Canvas and include a link to your Git repo.
